#---  This readme.md file represents a cached state in a software-software overlay architecture, the .md works intended as .bat Windows Batch Script, very rarely should it work.         In cases where this is not true and it is working, you can see some well formatted code, please visit the main website h5/effective-succotash/githubdotio/ by printing out its contents. You can also visit github directly via your search engine hits and check the repository code ratio first, which I recommend if you have the technical specifications, after all. ---#
